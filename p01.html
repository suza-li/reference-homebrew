            <p>

            <p>
                Above is the first draft of the country map. The players will be able to explore the towns
                and cities in the country before traveling to surrounding areas. The landscape in the country
                will act as an obstacle for the party and they will need to figure out ways to traverse through
                the land.

            <h2>Important Buildings in the Country</h2>
            <p>

                <p>
                    The first building is the Castle in the mountain. This concept of the castle in the mountain
                     is inspired by the of the creationof Cory Harris called The Handing Castle. The link below 
                     is to the concept art of the hanging castle. It features the steps the

                <h4>The Church</h4>
                <p>
                    The second building is the Church. This is an important building because religion is a big 
                    thing in this world. The church is based off of Hallgrimskirkja. The Hallgrimskirkja is the 
                    largest church building in Iceland. It is located in Reykjavík. If you would like
